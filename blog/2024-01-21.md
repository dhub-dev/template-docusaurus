# **Welcome to Your Blog!**

Greetings from Dhub the team! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to [Dhub](https://dhub.dev), your all-in-one markdown editor for [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) framework.

We are thrilled to have you on board and can't wait to see the amazing content you create!

## 1 minute tutorial

### Add content

Type `/` to reveal a list of available components.
Select one, like `Heading 1` or `Image` and it to the document.

### Create a New Blog Post

- Click **"â€¢â€¢â€¢"** on the **"blog"** folder in the sidebar and choose **"New file..."**.
- Give it a name like a date of the post like `2024-05-01` and hit enter. Dhub will add `.mdx` suffix automatically.

:::tip

Dhub supports both `.md` and `.mdx` although `.mdx` is more versatile.

### Push to Github

Hit the "Push to Github" at the top right.

Dhub automates all the necessary steps to put your content on GitHub. No need to learn `git`.

### Publish on the web

For publishing, we recommend using external platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). They seamlessly integrate with Docusaurus.

You can publish to Vercel right from Dhub.
